Problem statement chosen : 
Petrol Pump An app to locate the nearest petrol pump along the National Highways with details regarding time of operation and other services available.

Our Idea:
We have created a website which tracks the locations of petrol pumps.
That website uses Google maps API for the data of petrol pumps like latitude and longitude, name of the petrol pumps, routing from the current location.
We have used ‘geolocation API’ for tracking the live location of the user. This website tells the user about the petrol pumps located in nearby areas.

Cons of this idea:
Cost 
This cannot be used if number of users is large.
As it is relying on Google Maps API and the cost of using this API increases as the user base increases. 
If number of users are less then this can be one of the optimal solutions.

Solution 
As we are relying on Google mainly for the petrol pumps data. 
Most of the other functions like map and current location of user can be found out by using other free APIs.
What we need is data of these petrol pumps. As of now, we are figuring a way out to collect this data.

You can see the screenshots of the website in the repository.

We aren’t submitting the hosted website because of the billing issues of API. But we can show a demo of the website while presenting. 
Also we haven’t included the API key in the code.
